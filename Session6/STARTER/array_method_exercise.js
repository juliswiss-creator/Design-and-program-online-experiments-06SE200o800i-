/*
 Scenario: Suppose you ran a short memory quiz and stored results in an array called 'trials' which each element as an object to restore the correctness
 */

const trials = [
  { correct: true },
  { correct: false },
  { correct: true },
  { correct: true },
  { correct: false }
];

 /* exercise 6.2.1 */
 
// You goal is to calculate the overall accuracy (0-1).

// An example of using filter()

const correctTrials = trials.filter(trial => trial.correct);

//const correctTrials = trials.filter(trial => trial.correct);
//const correctCount = correctTrials.length;
//const acc = correctCount/trials.length
//console.log("Accuracy :", acc); // 0.6


// Given the example of using filter(), can you use forEach() instead to achieve the same goal?

/* Hit:
 1.use forEach to get correct count, divided by total length to get accuracy
 2.if you wish to test it: Add array_method_exercise.js to session6.html*/

let correctCount = 0;
// start add your code here

// your code end
console.log("Correct answers:", correctCount);
const acc =  correctCount/trials.length;
console.log("Accuracy:", acc);
