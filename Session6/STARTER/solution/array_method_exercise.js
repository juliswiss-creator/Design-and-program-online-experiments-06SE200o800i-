 Scenario: Suppose you ran a short memory quiz and stored results in an array called 'trials' which each element as an object to restore the correctness

//const correctTrials = trials.filter(trial => trial.correct);
//const correctCount = correctTrials.length;
//const acc = correctCount/trials.length
//console.log("Accuracy :", acc); // 0.6


// Given the example of using filter(), can you use forEach() instead to achieve the same goal?

 1.use forEach to get correct count, divided by total length to get accuracy
