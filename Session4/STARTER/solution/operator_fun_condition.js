YOUR TASK is to use a conditional statement (e.g., if-else) or a conditional operator (e.g., ternary operator) to evaluate the participant's age.

If the age is between 18 and 35 (inclusive), log the following message to the console:
"The current participant's age is, X, within 18-35; Participant is eligible for the experiment", where X is the participant's age, e.g., 17.

If the age is outside this range, display an alert() with the message:
"Participant is not eligible for the experiment due to age!".

/* Plus 3: 
You are conducting a psychology experiment that requires participants to meet specific eligibility criteria. The rules are as follows:

1) Participants must be between 18 and 35 years old (age).

2) Participants must not have participated in a similar experiment before (hasParticipatedBefore).

3) Participants must have normal or corrected-to-normal vision (hasNormalVision).

4) Participants must not have any known cognitive impairments (hasCognitiveImpairment).

YOUR TASK is to:
    1. write function in hello.js that determines whether a participant is eligible for the experiment based on the criteria above;
    2. Use console.log to output one of the following messages based on the result: "Participant is eligible for the experiment." or "Participant is not eligible for the experiment!";
    3. Test your program with different combinations of the variables to ensure it works correctly. For example:
    let ageInput = 25; // or 17                                         
    let hasParticipatedBefore = false; // or True
    let hasNormalVisionOrNot = true;
    let hasCognitiveImpairment = false;

    let ageInput = 25; // or 17                                         
    let hasParticipatedBefore = false; // or True
    let hasNormalVisionOrNot = true;
    let hasCognitiveImpairment = false;
    console.log("age:", ageInput, "participated before?", hasParticipatedBefore, "normal vision:",hasNormalVisionOrNot, "cognitive impairment:",hasCognitiveImpairment)
    // will this be eligible?

    ageInput = 17;                                         
    hasParticipatedBefore = false; // or True
    hasNormalVisionOrNot = true;
    hasCognitiveImpairment = false;
    console.log("age:", ageInput, "participated before?", hasParticipatedBefore, "normal vision:",hasNormalVisionOrNot, "cognitive impairment:",hasCognitiveImpairment)
    // will this be eligible?

    ageInput = 25;                                         
    hasParticipatedBefore = true; 
    hasNormalVisionOrNot = true;
    hasCognitiveImpairment = false;
    console.log("age:", ageInput, "participated before?", hasParticipatedBefore, "normal vision:",hasNormalVisionOrNot, "cognitive impairment:",hasCognitiveImpairment)
